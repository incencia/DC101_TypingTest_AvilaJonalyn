# Assets Folder

This folder is for storing game assets such as:
- Images (icons, backgrounds, etc.)
- Sound effects (optional)
- Fonts (if not using web fonts)
- Other media files

For this typing test game, no assets are currently needed as it uses:
- Web fonts from Google Fonts
- CSS-based styling and animations
- Unicode emojis for visual elements

If you want to add sound effects for typing feedback or background music, place them here.
