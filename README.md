## 🎯 Game Mechanics

### WPM Calculation
- Based on the standard: 5 characters = 1 word
- Calculated in real-time as you type
- Formula: `(characters typed / 5) / time elapsed in minutes`

### Accuracy Calculation
- Percentage of correctly typed characters
- Updates continuously during the test
- Formula: `(correct characters / total characters) × 100`

### Performance Levels
- **Outstanding** (60+ WPM, 95%+ accuracy): 🏆 Champion level!
- **Great** (45+ WPM, 90%+ accuracy): 👏 Excellent skills!
- **Good** (30+ WPM, 80%+ accuracy): 💪 Keep practicing!
- **Decent** (20+ WPM, 70%+ accuracy): 📈 Getting better!
- **Beginner** (< 20 WPM or < 70% accuracy): 🎯 Practice makes perfect!
